  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>
    Interested in the field of Machine Learning? Then this course is for you!<br />

    This course has been designed by two professional Data Scientists so that we can share our knowledge and help you learn complex theory, algorithms, and coding libraries in a simple way.<br />

    <br>We will walk you step-by-step into the World of Machine Learning. With every tutorial, you will develop new skills and improve your understanding of this challenging yet lucrative sub-field of Data Science.

    <br /><br>This course is fun and exciting, but at the same time, we dive deep into Machine Learning. It is structured the following way:
  <ul>
    <li>Part 1 - Data Preprocessing</li>
    <li>Part 2 - Regression: Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, SVR, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression</li>

   <li>Part 3 - Classification: Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification</li>

    <li>Part 4 - Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering</li>

    <li>  Part 5 - Association Rule Learning: Apriori, Eclat</li>

    <li>Part 6 - Reinforcement Learning: Upper Confidence Bound, Thompson Sampling</li>

    <li>Part 7 - Natural Language Processing: Bag-of-words model and algorithms for NLP</li>

    <li>Part 8 - Deep Learning: Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks</li>

    <li>Part 9 - Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, LDA, Kernel PCA</li>

    <li>Part 10 - Model Selection & Boosting: k-fold Cross Validation, Parameter Tuning, Grid Search, XGBoost</li>
  </ul>


    Moreover, the course is packed with practical exercises that are based on real-life examples. So not only will you learn the theory, but you will also get some hands-on practice building your own models.

    <br>And as a bonus, this course includes both Python and R code templates which you can download and use on your own projects.

    <br>Important updates (June 2020):
   <ul>
     <li>CODES ALL UP TO DATE</li>

     <li>DEEP LEARNING CODED IN TENSORFLOW 2.0</li>

     <li>TOP GRADIENT BOOSTING MODELS INCLUDING XGBOOST AND EVEN CATBOOST!</li>
   </ul>
